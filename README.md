# tonebase Technical Interview - FullStack (Front-End Focus)

Welcome to the tonebase Technical Interview! Congratulations, if you're here it means we think you'd make a great addition to the team, based on your past experience, personality and kick-ass skills!

This interview is a small/short test of those skills. Ideally the questions presented and the challenges involved should take no more than 1 hour for an experienced full-stack developer with React chops.

The initial portion of this interview is simply answering a few technical, front-end and React based questions. We can talk through these on a call as I'd love to hear how you think about them/through them!

#### Types of Questions

This interview has been created for someone who considers themselves a full-stack developer with a focus on the front-end. Very concretely what we mean by this is you feel comfortable spinning up an express server and handling MVC based routes, controlles and middleware... but you really feel at home diving into some React or Vue code and ironing out cross-browser bugs and optimizing SCSS patterns. Or you feel comfortable everywhere, which is even better :)

Okay, with all that out of the way let's dive into the question section!

### 1. What made you interested in/choose React as a framework? Was it a choice you made? Regardless, what is the one thing you enjoy most about it compared to other frameworks you've used and what is one thing you dislike about it?

I didn't personally choose React, it was already picked as the staple front-end framework of Hack Reactor's curriculum. That said, I've been happily continuing to develop with it as opposed to learning something else. React's clear Javascript structure makes it easy for me to read and write, and I love the ability to weave JS and html together in JSX. One detraction for me is that React can require a good amount of pre-planning to avoid time-consuming refactors down the road, such as changing functional components to class components, or changing the overall app structure to avoid unnecessary re-renders or unmounting/mounting of components.

### 2. Why do the component names in JSX start with capital letters?

Lower-case tag names compile as html elements; React components are capitalized to differentiate them from basic html elements so that the JSX block compiles correctly.

### 3. What are the main types of components you can render in React? When do you choose one over the other?

There are two main React component types - class and function. In general, you would choose a functional component if the component is state-less, and just renders from the props being passed in (though you can introduce state capabilites with the useState hook). Class components are used when your components have state and/or you want to use lifecycle hooks.

### 4. How much experience do you have with testing frameworks? While our testing is light at the moment (read: nonexistent) this is something we'd like to move to in the future so this is a 'nice-to-know' for us!

I have experience using Mocha/Chai/Jasmine for vanilla JS testing, and Jest/Enzyme for testing React components. I've also successfully implemented continuous integration/automated testing using CircleCI, though only used on one project.

Whew, okay, now moving into a couple of code questions. We don't need you to code anything just yet, but this is more around optimization and undertstanding JS/React.

### 1. What is wrong with this example, and how would you go about fixing or improving the component?

```
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      name: this.props.name || 'Anonymous'
    }
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <p>Hello {this.state.name}</p>
    );
  }
}
```

1. the component only renders a single element based off of an unchanged input value (prop),
so it seems unnecessary to make it a class component.
2. the state variable 'name' is just making a copy of the prop, which creates two sources
for the same value. There should be only "one source of truth".

Here's how I would refactor this component:
```
const App = (props) => {
  return (
    <p>Hello {props.name || "Anonymous"}<p>
  );
}
```

### 2. What's the issue with this component. Why? How would you go about fixing it?

```
class App extends React.Component {
state = { search: '' }
handleChange = event => {
/**
     * This is a simple implementation of a "debounce" function,
     * which will queue an expression to be called in 250ms and
     * cancel any pending queued expressions. This way we can
     * delay the call 250ms after the user has stoped typing.
     */
    clearTimeout(this.timeout);
    this.timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      this.setState({
        search: event.target.value
      })
    }, 250);
  }
render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <input type="text" onChange={this.handleChange} />
        {this.state.search ? <p>Search for: {this.state.search}</p> : null}
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

1. The state is being initialized incorrectly as a private variable / the component is missing a constructor.
2. In the handleChange method, the clearTimeout line will cause an error as this.timeout hasn't
been defined yet. Also, handleChange itself isn't properly defined as a method, and needs to be bound to the component as well.
3. The styling of the code is a little messy - it would benefit from better use of indentation/line spacing among other minor adjustments.

Here's how I would refactor this component:
```
class App extends React.Component {
  contructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      search: '',
    };

    this.timeout;
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
  }

  handleChange(event) {
    /**
     * This is a simple implementation of a "debounce" function,
     * which will queue an expression to be called in 250ms and
     * cancel any pending queued expressions. This way we can
     * delay the call 250ms after the user has stoped typing.
     */
    clearTimeout(this.timeout);
    this.timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      this.setState({
        search: event.target.value
      })
    }, 250);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <input type="text" onChange={this.handleChange} />
        {this.state.search ? <p>Search for: {this.state.search}</p> : null}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

Onto just a teensy bit of code + introducing you to our system! This part can be done on your own, and you can ping me when it's good to go!

Here is a link to a Github repo. containing our NextJS setup. It includes everything already setup for you -- SCSS support, a blank canvas for you to play with, and all the boileplate out of the way.

[The Github Repo.](https://github.com/tonebase/tonebase-interviews-fs-fe)

**Your challenge is to implement ONE of the following:**

1. OPTION 1: Implement a simple counter
  
  For this assignment you may use a state management system of your choice (other than the native React state). We recommend `react-easy-state` as that is our default tool and is extremely simple to get up and running.

  The counter should:

  (a) Increment UP once per hour between 9AM and 5PM (inclusive)

  (b) Increment DOWN once per hour between 6PM and 8AM (inclusive)

  (c) Increment UP when a button is clicked manually

  (d) Increment DOWN when a different button is clicked manually


2. OPTION 2: Build the Google homepage (www.google.com)

  Open-ended, go into as much or as little detail as makes sense to you. Responsiveness, functionality, modularity, etc. is all up to you -- we want to know how you interpret this prompt. Feel free to get as creative or keep it as simple as you would like. Your code will be evaluated along the following criteria:
  - Functionality
  - Creativity
  - Readability
  - Cleanliness
  - Comments
  - Modularity
  - Defensiveness
  - Declarative-ness


**When Complete**

When you're good to go with your implementation and/or happy with it feel free to make a P.R. into this repo. under a new branch titled `${ YOUR_NAME--FullStack--FrontEnd }`

Lastly, just a bit of writing! We are a company where members of the team are constantly shifting around/traveling, whether to China to manage our upcoming subsidiary there, or to New York and Europe to head productions, attend events, etc.

Thus writing, and the ability to write clearly, logically and to formulate arguments and answers is crucial at tonebase, whether a developer, PM, or A&R manager! These questions aim to give us a better understanding of you as a writer, as well as your development skills.

### 1. Tell me about componentWillMount and the issues with it?

### 2. Can you walk me through the cycle of mounting a stateful component? What functions are called in what order? Where would you place a request for data from the API? Why?

### 3. If you had unlimited time budget and could fix / improve / change one thing in your last project, what would it be and why?

---

That's it! Now it's your time -- feel free to ask any questions you may have and we'd love to answer to the best of our abilities. Thank you so much for taking the time to do this quick interview - we can't wait to see your answers and see if there's a way for us to work together!

At tonebase we truly believe in the following principles:

1. To Educate & Inspire In Everything We Do
1. Think Big, Then Think Bigger
1. Align Around The Mission, Execute Against The Vision
1. Start And End With The Customer
1. Culture Doesn't Just Happen, It's Crafted

We'll let you know very soon if you've moved into the next phase of the interview. In the next step we will introduce you to the founders, our mission + vision, core company values and to our small, close-knit and wonderful team. We're all excited to see where things go and will be in touch ASAP.
